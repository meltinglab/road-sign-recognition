# road-sign-recognition
Road sign recognition

Aim of the project: build and train a Neural Network for road sign classification and 
deployment on Raspberry Pi.

Dataset: German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset
http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset

Steps: 
1) Read the dataset and split the images in training set and validation set
2) Image preprocessing
3) Build the network (mResNet) 
4) Define training options and train the network in MATLAB
5) Validationn of the network
6) Write the code for the deployment on Raspberry Pi
7) Deploy the network and verify the results
